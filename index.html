                <p>My name is Arvin Mahmoudi. I was born on September 21,1985 in a small town named,
                    Baneh, just west of Iran. In 2007, I graduated with an associate degree for computer
                    hardware/software. At the end of 2016, I had the opportunity to move to the United
                    States. With a fresh start and a new life with my family, I took my first job at an electrical
                    company. With no experience, I became an electrician! Every day I pushed myself to
                    learn something new and excel at what I was doing. It was interesting and a very great
                    experience, but I wasn’t happy. Like everyone, I had an American dream that I had
                    envisioned for myself. My dream was to be a developer. For a short time, I decided to
                    go back to school and get a college degree. That period of my life was very busy due to
                    raising my two kids and maintaining a job at the same time. Not being able to manage
                    everything, I had to drop out after my first semester. Though I quit, I thought about my
                    dream every day and I was still determined.</p>

                <p>Learning code and being a developer
                    wasn’t just going to be my “dream” anymore, it was going to become my plan! For me to
                    be able have a better life for my family and myself and to be happy, I had to complete
                    that missing part my part of my life.
                    I have finally gotten back on track! I have managed
                    the time and resources to study as a web developer at Georgia Tech Bootcamp. Life
                    couldn’t be better at the moment. I have a great family and pursuing a discipline that I’m
                    very passionate about. These days, I keep a focused attitude and determination in all
                    aspects in my life. Not only do I like to push myself mentally, but also, physically! My
                    favorite time is when I’m in the gym. I love to work out! And like everyone, Music to top it
                    off!
